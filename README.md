# My First Penetration Testing Portfolio

Welcome! This repo contains my first two vulnerability assessments from hands-on labs.

- **Metasploitable** – Exploiting vsftpd 2.3.4 Backdoor (RCE)
- **bWAPP** – Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on HTTP login

These were done as part of my journey into **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)**.

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- Metasploit
- Burp Suite (Community Edition)
- Firefox (with proxy settings)
- Docker (for bWAPP)

## Why I Made This
I want to showcase real examples of vulnerabilities I’ve explored and documented.
